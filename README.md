# Kea Framework

Many of Public Invention's projects are based on accessible prototyping platforms such as Arduino and PlatformIO. This enables people to collaborate and interate rapidly on useful inventions.

As we have gained experience in several projects, from water quality metering to controlling NASA's solid state oxygen concentrator, we have discovered a need for bridging the prototype to the field deployment in a way that is still accessible for on-going development.

This framework aims to provide a level of robustness to our projects that may help to deploy them at scale in the field.

## First Steps

The first steps for this project are to break out the heritage code from the NASA MCOG project and make them available here as a library that can be imported using Arduino or PlatformIO.

## Cross-Platform Support

There is a wide range of hardware available today in accessible and modular forms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and ESP32. These provide low-cost, low-power compute with a wide range of features. The Kea framework aims to simplify cross-platform support by building on top of popular build tools.
